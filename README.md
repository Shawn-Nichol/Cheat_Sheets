Welcome to my cybersecurity utility belt! Here, you'll discover a comprehensive list of tools I employ across various facets of cybersecurity. Each section provides concise descriptions and examples of the tools utilized in different contexts. From network security to encryption and beyond, explore the arsenal of tools I use to fortify digital defenses and safeguard information.

# Malware Analysis
**Procmon** </br>
(System Internals): This is a monitoring tool for Windows OS. It provides real-time monitoring and logging of various system activities, including file system and registry access, process and thread activity, network activity, and more. 

**Noriben** </br>
is an open-source Python-based script used for sandboxing and analyzing malware behavior on Windows OS. It is primarily designed to complement tools like Procmon by automating data collection generated during malware execution within a controlled environment. 


# Password Cracking
**hashcat** 
is an open-source password recovery tool used to crack hashed passwords through brute-force attacks, dictionary attacks, and hybrid attacks. It supports various hashing algorithms and utilizes the power of GPU for accelerated processing. 

**fcrackzip**
It is a command-line tool primarily used for cracking passwords of encrypted ZIP files. It performs a brute-force attack or dictionary attack to guess the password protecting the ZIP archive.

# Digital forensics
**Photorec**
Photorec is a data recovery software that retrieves lost or deleted files from storage devices like hard drives, memory cards, and USB drives. It identifies file signatures rather than relying on the file system, enabling it to recover various file types even when damaged or corrupted. 

**Steghide**
is a command-line tool used for hiding or encrypting sensitive data with various types of files, such as images or audio files. It employs steganography techniques to embed secret information into the cover file without visibly altering the file's appearance or functionality. Steghide uses a passphrase for encryption, allowing users to conceal information securely within other files, protecting it from casual observation or unauthorized access. 

**exiftool**
A command-line tool used for reading, writing, and editing metadata information within various types of files, particularly image files such as JPEG, TIFF, RAW, and others. 


# Malware Analysis
**Gihrad**
A open-source software suite developed by the NSA, designed for reverse engineering tasks to analyze compiled code across various platforms with disassembling and decompiling capabilities and supports multiple architectures.

# Log Analysis
**aureport**
is a tool that produces summary reports of audit system logs. The aureport utility  can also take input from stdin as long as the input is the raw log data.
