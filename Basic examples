## Nmap Scan Examples

Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful open-source network scanning tool used for discovering hosts and services on a computer network. It offers various scan techniques and options that can be controlled using command-line tags. Here are some common Nmap tags along with example usage:

### Basic Scan
Discover live hosts within a target network.
```bash
nmap 192.168.1.0/24
```

### Port Scan
Specify ports to scan on target hosts.
```bash
nmap -p 80,443 192.168.1.1
```

### Aggressive Scan
Comprehensive scan with OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
```bash
nmap -A 192.168.1.1
```

### Operating System Detection
Determine the OS running on target hosts.
```bash
nmap -O 192.168.1.1
```

### Service Version Detection
Detect versions of services on open ports.
```bash
nmap -sV 192.168.1.1
```

### UDP Port Scan
Perform UDP scan on target hosts.
```bash
nmap -sU 192.168.1.1
```

### Ping Scan (Host Discovery)
Determine live hosts using ICMP echo requests.
```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```

### Script Scan
Run Nmap scripts against target hosts for more information.
```bash
nmap -sC 192.168.1.1
```

### Timing Templates
Adjust scan speed using predefined timing templates.
```bash
nmap -T4 192.168.1.1
```

### Output Formats
Specify the output format of scan results.
```bash
nmap -oN scan_results.txt 192.168.1.1
```

### Exclude Hosts
Exclude specific hosts from the scan.
```bash
nmap 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude 192.168.1.10
```

Remember to use Nmap responsibly and with proper authorization. Unethical or illegal use of network scanning tools can have serious consequences.
