Nmap (Network Mapper) is a powerful open-source network scanning tool used for discovering hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a "map" of the network's topology. Nmap uses various scan techniques and options to gather information about the target network. Nmap scans are controlled using a variety of command-line options and arguments, often referred to as "Nmap tags" or "Nmap switches." Here are some commonly used Nmap tags along with examples of how to use them:

1. Basic Scan:
   This is a simple scan to discover live hosts within a target network.
   Example:
   ```
   nmap 192.168.1.0/24
   ```

2. Port Scan:
   Specify the ports to scan on target hosts. Default is the top 1000 TCP ports.
   Example:
   ```
   nmap -p 80,443 192.168.1.1
   ```

3. Aggressive Scan (All ports and scripts):
   This scan includes an OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
   Example:
   ```
   nmap -A 192.168.1.1
   ```

4. Operating System Detection:
   Determine the operating system running on target hosts.
   Example:
   ```
   nmap -O 192.168.1.1
   ```

5. Service Version Detection:
   Detect the version of services running on open ports.
   Example:
   ```
   nmap -sV 192.168.1.1
   ```

6. UDP Port Scan:
   Perform a UDP scan on target hosts.
   Example:
   ```
   nmap -sU 192.168.1.1
   ```

7. Ping Scan (Host Discovery):
   Determine live hosts using ICMP echo requests.
   Example:
   ```
   nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
   ```

8. Script Scan:
   Run Nmap scripts against target hosts to gather more information.
   Example:
   ```
   nmap -sC 192.168.1.1
   ```

9. Timing Templates:
   Adjust scan speed using predefined timing templates.
   Example:
   ```
   nmap -T4 192.168.1.1
   ```

10. Output Formats:
    Specify the output format of the scan results.
    Example:
    ```
    nmap -oN scan_results.txt 192.168.1.1
    ```

11. Exclude Hosts:
    Exclude specific hosts from the scan.
    Example:
    ```
    nmap 192.168.1.0/24 --exclude 192.168.1.10
    ```

These are just a few examples of Nmap tags and their usage. Nmap provides a wide range of options to tailor scans according to specific requirements, network sizes, and security objectives. It's important to note that Nmap can be a powerful tool, and using it on networks you don't own or have proper authorization for can be illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have the right permissions before conducting scans on any network.
